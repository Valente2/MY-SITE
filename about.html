        <p>
               Hello! My name is Valente, (if you didn't know that already). I am a software "deveolper", but I have a lot of other passions including music, physocolgy (speficaly ASD) and areospace. I also have a passion for reading and chemistry. 
               My passions are my main insperation for my work in software, my work in writing, and my actions in life. My hopes are to one day combine all of my passions into one career, but until then I will keep working on them seperatly.
                This is one of my newer passions, web deveolpment and Aarch32 asembly. 
                This is one of my smaller pages on this site I hope I make up for it with my other pages.
        </p>
